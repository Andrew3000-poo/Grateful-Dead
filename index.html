      Recorded 			    from April - November of 1972, Europe ‘72 is a compilation of all of - 	as   the            title suggests - the best songs from the live shows that The Grateful       Dead                perfomed during their 1972 European tour.  The Tour was such a large                 expence for the Warner Brothers and Grateful Dead  that they resolved           to                        record  all of the shows and release them on vinyl to make up for the                     costs of the tour. At the end of the tour the best performances were compiled to release another record alongside all of the indivual performances that had been recorded and released.
